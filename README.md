# Income Prediction based on US Census Data

**Data science project of feature engineering and classification tasks.**

Given the Income Census dataset, the goal is to accomplish some tasks on feature engineering and then apply some machine learning (ML) algorithms for classification purpose of census public data.

### **Dataset Information:**

[Census Income Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income): http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income

> Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 US Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: (AAGE>16) and (AGI>100) and (AFNLWGT>1) and (HRSWK>0).

### **Task's description**

**The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year (income exceeds $50K/yr) based on census data.** Also known as "Adult" dataset.
